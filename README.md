<h2>Happy Numbers </h2>
Have the function <span style="color:red;">HappyNumbers(num)</span> determine if a number is Happy, which is a number whose sum of the square of the digits eventually converges to 1. Return true if it's a Happy number, otherwise return false.

For example: the number 10 is Happy because 1^2 + 0^2 converges to 1.
